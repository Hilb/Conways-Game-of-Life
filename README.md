# This is a representation of Conway's Game of Life with a graphical user interface, using JFrame.

In order to start the game, first clone the repository, then start the program by running the driver class. You should see an icon pop up on the screen which represents the field of play where the alive cells are colored yellow and the dead ones are blue.

Then based on a series of rules outlined here - https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway%27s_Game_of_Life#Rules the program will simulate the game of life.
